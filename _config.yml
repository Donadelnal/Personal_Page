  Hi, I'm Daniel and I work as a researcher in the Medical University of Lublin in Poland.
  
  In my research, I focus on the identification of transcriptomic biomarkers of peripheral vascular diseases to explain their pathogenesis and propose diagnostic and therapeutic targets. I use such technologies as Ion Torrent NGS sequencing, RT-qPCR, ELISA, and for data analysis and visualisation, I mainly use an excellent R environment.
  
  Working in innovative fields with amazing scientists allows me to make relevant discoveries, which is a great reward and a source of motivation and bravery to go further.
